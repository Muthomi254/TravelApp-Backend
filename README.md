Booking Website Backend README
Introduction

This README provides an overview of the backend of the booking website. The backend is developed using Flask, a Python web framework, and employs Blueprints to organize routes and functionalities effectively.
Features

    User Management: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    Company Management: Handles CRUD operations for companies offering services on the platform.
    Service Management: Manages traveling services and accommodation services provided by companies.
    Review System: Allows users to leave reviews for services provided by companies.
    Reservation System: Facilitates the booking of services offered by companies.
    Admin Panel: Provides admin functionalities for managing users, companies, services, and reservations.
    Authentication: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
    Database Integration: Utilizes a database to store user information, company details, services, reviews, reservations, etc.
    Seed Data: Includes a seed file to populate the database with initial data for testing and development.

Folder Structure

    Blueprints: Contains separate blueprints for different modules like user, company, service, review, reservation, etc.
    Models: Includes database models for user, company, service, review, reservation, etc.
    Utils: Houses utility functions and helper modules.
    Seed: Contains a seed file to populate the database with initial data.
    

Setup Instructions

    Clone the repository.
    Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Set up the database and migrations.
    Run the Flask application using python app.py

Deployment

    Choose a suitable hosting provider like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
    Set up the environment variables for production.
    Use WSGI servers like Gunicorn to serve the Flask application.
    Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.

Security Practices

    Implement JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
    Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
    Use HTTPS for secure communication.
    Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
    Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse and attacks.

Additional Notes

    Document API endpoints and payloads using tools like Swagger
    Consider implementing logging for monitoring and debugging.
    Use caching mechanisms for improved performance.
    Ensure compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations.
